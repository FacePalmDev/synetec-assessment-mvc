# Processing Multiple Salaries in Parallel using Vector Maths.

So I had a bit of fun with the calclations. I wanted to see if I could process multuple salary calculations simultanously as opposed to one at a time.
I managed to do this using vector maths to process multiple salaries in parallel. 

I think the code reads quite nicely and runs efficiently. 

I chose not to implement this as it was purely a refactoring task and this would fundamentally change the way that the code performed the calculation. 

Still I wanted to submit this as a future improvcement.

The code calculation harness is a working example of how I'd solve this if you wanted to support bulk processing.
